# **Cinnamon Cinemas Booking**
## ***Version 1.0***

### **Installation:**
    - Clone this repository using git clone https://github.com/vswapna3202/cinnamon_cinemas_project
    - Navigate to project directory cinnamon_cinemas_project 
    - Run mvn test to build and test the project
    
### **Application Start:**
    - Application will start by executing main method from class com.techreturners.app.BookingApp

### **Project Brief:** 
This application enables booking of seats at Cinnamon Cinemas. There are 3 rows named
A, B, C and each row has 5 seats. The customer can request booking of any number of
seats between 1 and 3. The booking is with seat allocation from left to right and then
front to back. Seats allocated to customer are saved and a ticket issued to customer.
When all seats have been booked the app automatically terminates.

### **Inputs:**
The application takes input from user through the console. The input is captured as follows:

    Welcome to Cinnamon Cinemas!
    Enter the following details:
    Enter your name:
    Enter your address:
    Enter your email:
    Enter your contact number:
    Enter number of seats between 1 and 3 for booking

### **Outputs:**
The ticket details are displayed to user with customer name, address, email and contact numbers. A message with number of seats in the 
booking and the ticket id with seat numbers and row numbers are displayed to user.
The app keeps running until all the seats are booked. It terminates automatically when
all seats have been booked.


### **Sample Output:**
    Dear Harry Potter  
    @ [ 4 Privet Drive Surrey UK - Contact:  07986541234]  
    Your 3 seat(s) has been booked  
    Your ticket Id is: 1000  
    It has been emailed to you @ harrypotter@hogwarts.com  
    Your seat numbers are:  
    Row: A Seat: ONE  
    Row: A Seat: TWO  
    Row: A Seat: THREE  

### **Assumptions:**
    - Customer can do booking of 1 to 3 seats
    - Row numbers are limited to A, B, C
    - Seat numbers are limited to 5 per row
    - Once all seats have been booked, when re-starting app for next booking check needs to be 
      done to ensure seatMapping.txt is empty. This is not done automatically in this release and 
      manual intervention is needed.

### **Future considerations:**
    - A data file is used to store the seats allocated and booked. This can be stored better in 
      a database with table structure. In future this could be a good extension to this current 
      project.
    - The booking system handles seat allocation for one film at the moment and this could be added 
      to selection of films as well before booking the seats.
    - The seats and rows are fixed and limited at the moment this could be extended to more seats and rows.
